# RCloud Cheatsheet

This short guide shows you how to get everything ready to start using R in the cloud. No installations, no setup required!

By the end, you’ll have your own **RCloud workspace** (*think of it as your online R*) and a project that contains all the materials for this training.

You’ll be able to run R code directly in your browser, just like working in Word or Excel online.

- 🕒 Setup time: about 5–10 minutes

- ✅ You only need to do this once: after that, you’ll be ready to jump straight into the training or create your own future projects.

**What you’ll do in this guide**

1. **Create a Free RCloud Account**: so you can log in and save your work.

1. **Create a New Workspace**: your personal space for projects.

1. **Create a New Project**: your copy of the training materials (or any other R project you want to start).


## 1. Create a Free RCloud Account

If this is your first time using [Posit Cloud (formerly RCloud)](https://posit.cloud/plans/free), you’ll need to create an account.

*If you already have an account, skip ahead to the next section.*

**Steps:**

1. Go to https://posit.cloud/plans/free and click **Sign Up**.

1. Choose one of the following options:

    - Sign up with Google (fastest option), or

    - Sign up with email (recommended if you prefer to use your institutional email).

## 2. Create a New Workspace

A **workspace** in RCloud (Posit Cloud) is like a folder that holds all your projects. For this training, you’ll create a new workspace so your projects stay organised.

**Steps:**

1. In your RCloud dashboard, search for `Your Workspaces` in the left-hand menu and **click the blue `New Workspace`** button (red square in the screenshot below).

1. Give your workspace a simple name and click `Create`. For this training you can name your workspace like:
    
    ```
    vu-spc-R-training
    ```


You should then see the new Workspace in the left-hand menu.

## 3. Create a New Project

A project is where your R scripts, data, and results live.
In this step, you’ll create a new project that already includes all the materials for this training.

**Steps:**

1. Inside your workspace, click the blue `New Project` button (top right corner - see *box 1* in the screenshot below).

1. Select `New Project from Git Repository` (see *box 1* in the screenshot below).

1. When prompted for the repository URL, paste the link to this repository (see *box 3* in the screenshot below ):

    `https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-vu-2025-r-training`

1. Click OK.

Wait a few moments while RCloud copies all the files.

Once it’s done, your project will open automatically and you are ready to explore and work with R!
